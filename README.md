## Welcome to ExpensiData!
This repository contains the scripts I use to process data. If you've never run one of these before, you'll want to get yourself set up.

### First, download the programs you need
1. Download [R](http://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/). This is the program that does all the work.
2. (Optional but recommended.) Download [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). This is an integrated development environment (IDE) that consolidates the tools you'll most commonly need into one program/window. In contrast, R doesn't natively do this, often requiring extra work. Choose the free version.


### Then, make sure you're prepared to run what you need to run
1. Run any initial setup files associated with the specific project you're working on. This will install any required libraries (i.e., different packages of pre-built functions) necessary to run the main script.
2. Make sure you've examined the main script for any OS-specific instructions. Commented lines begin with a hashtag and will say something like "If you're on OS X, uncomment this line and comment out the line above this, which will only work on Windows." Oftentimes there are extra steps required for Macs/machines running OS X.

## In general, Google is your friend!
R can (and will) throw error messages, and they'll be slightly different each time. Don't panic! This is normal. Just Google the error message or reach out for help!
